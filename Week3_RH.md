# Technical Research and Literature Review:

Conduct an in-depth reading of the core content in the paper "Ad Hoc Transactions in Web Applications: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," especially focusing on the sections discussing locking mechanisms, usage, errors, and performance issues​(ad hoc Trans).
Research current implementations of optimistic locking, understanding how it works, its use cases, and its pros and cons. Investigate how optimistic concurrency control (OCC) is used in databases and how version control is used to ensure correctness in concurrent updates in web applications.

# Problem Definition and Requirements Clarification:

Based on the research, clearly define the existing problems with locking mechanisms in web applications, particularly focusing on concurrency issues and error-prone behavior as highlighted in the paper​(ad hoc Trans).
Categorize the specific issues that need to be addressed, such as identifying the scenarios where performance bottlenecks occur or where lock failures or deadlocks happen. This will help establish clear goals for designing solutions in the following stages.

# Outline Solution Framework:

Begin drafting an initial framework for the improvements. Start by thinking about how to introduce optimistic locking into the existing system and how version control and validation mechanisms can be used to minimize conflicts in concurrent transactions.
Explore the technical details of implementing optimistic locking: How will you ensure transaction atomicity? How will you handle conflict resolution when version validation fails? These considerations will help form the initial technical roadmap for the project.
